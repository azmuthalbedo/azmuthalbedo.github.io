<h1>Meet Chris</h1>
 <p> Chris is a writer and novice programmer, but first a thinker. He spends most of his time researching, analyzing and articulating thoughts in concise formats while preserving cognitive precision. He sees himself as a noble Knight wielding the sword of knowledge against ignorance.<br/><br/>
     Cyberspace is also one of the tools he employs for his quest. But here, he's a Wizard and not a Knight, given his ability to manipulate cyberspace wielding the magic of codes.<br><br>
     He lives by the following principles;<br> "Logic first in all things"<br> "The knowledge of a thing is the destruction of its mystery, therefore seek knowledge".<br><br> He's currently studying computer science at the of Federal University of Technology, Minna.</p>
